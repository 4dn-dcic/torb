# Torb

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/4dn-dcic/torb.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/4dn-dcic/torb)

Torbj√∂rn is the builder bot that builds our application and handles the automated deployment. It uses AWS Step Functions to orchestrate a number of individual lambda functions that control the various steps required for deployment and management of our servers.

## Torb Lambda Functions
For the most part, Torb is defined by a number of lambda functions that are bundled and deployed using our fork of [python-lambda](https://github.com/4dn-dcic/python-lambda).

### create_beanstalk
Lambda function name: `create-beanstalk`. [Link](./torb/create_beanstalk/).

Workflows: used in `ff_deploy_staging`

Provide a variety of inputs (see service.py) to create a new ElasticBeanstalk (EB) environment or update an existing one. As part of this process, set EB environment variables and a configuration template. Also attempts to PUT a Foursight environment corresponding to the created EB environment.

### create_es
Lambda function name: `create-es`. [Link](./torb/create_es/).

Workflows: used in `ff_deploy_staging`

Provide input with `dest_env` to create a new Elasticsearch (ES) instance with the given identifier. Can optionally use `force_new_es` to always create a new ES instance, but this should probably not be used, as creating an ES instance by hand is usually the way to go. Updates `id` and `type` in event JSON to coordinate with `waitfor` Lambda.

### create_rds
Lambda function name: `create-rds`. [Link](./torb/create_rds/).

Workflows: None

Provide input with `dest_env` and `snapshot_arn` to create an RDS instance with the given ID from the given snapshot ARN. If a current instance already exists with that ID, this will delete it. If "fourfront-webprod" is in the ID, will skip this process due to the danger of deleting the production database.

### snapshot_rds
Lambda function name: `snapshot-rds`. [Link](./torb/snapshot_rds/).

Workflows: None

Provide input with `dest_env` and `snapshot_id` to take a snapshot of an RDS instance with the given ID. The snapshot will have the given name and will delete any existing snapshot with that name.

### travis_deploy
Lambda function name: `travis-deploy`. [Link](./torb/travis_deploy/).

Workflows: used in `ff_deploy_staging`

Start a travis build and leverage the `tibanna_deploy` environment variables for the travis build to deploy to the "fourfront-mastertest" ElasticBeanstalk on a successful build. Can also leverage `merge_to` to merge a given branch into another one at the end of the build. Branches are determined by `event` and `merge_into` in the event JSON; ElasticBeanstalk environment is set with `dest_env`. See the [Fourfront travis config](https://github.com/4dn-dcic/fourfront/blob/d477c04181ff097bfd7fa59092c18e0c13540a90/.travis.yml#L106-L118) and [deploy_beanstalk.py](https://github.com/4dn-dcic/fourfront/blob/master/deploy/deploy_beanstalk.py) for how this is done. This is a bit different from `trigger_mastertest_build` and `trigger_webdev_build`, since it propogates the event output and therefore can be used within a step function. Writes request information to the `travis` subobject in the event. Also updates `id` and `type` in event to coordinate with `waitfor` Lambda.

### trigger_mastertest_build
Lambda function name: `trigger-mastertest-build`. [Link](./torb/trigger_mastertest_build/).

Workflows: None

Start a travis build and leverage the `tibanna_deploy` environment variable for the travis build to deploy to the "fourfront-mastertest" ElasticBeanstalk on a successful build. See the [Fourfront travis config](https://github.com/4dn-dcic/fourfront/blob/d477c04181ff097bfd7fa59092c18e0c13540a90/.travis.yml#L106-L118) and [deploy_beanstalk.py](https://github.com/4dn-dcic/fourfront/blob/master/deploy/deploy_beanstalk.py) for how this is done. No information is needed from the lambda event JSON. Almost identical functionality to `trigger_webdev_build`.

### trigger_staging_build
Lambda function name: `trigger-staging-build`. [Link](./torb/trigger_staging_build/).

Workflows: triggers `ff_deploy_staging`

Use `dcicutils.beanstalk_utils.compute_ff_prd_env` to determine which environments are data and staging, and kick off the `ff_deploy_staging` step function to make a fresh deploy to staging using Fourfront master. No information is needed from the lambda event JSON.

### trigger_webdev_build
Lambda function name: `trigger-webdev-build`. [Link](./torb/trigger_webdev_build/).

Workflows: None

Start a travis build and leverage the `tibanna_deploy` environment variable for the travis build to deploy to the "fourfront-webdev" ElasticBeanstalk on a successful build. See the [Fourfront travis config](https://github.com/4dn-dcic/fourfront/blob/d477c04181ff097bfd7fa59092c18e0c13540a90/.travis.yml#L106-L118) and [deploy_beanstalk.py](https://github.com/4dn-dcic/fourfront/blob/master/deploy/deploy_beanstalk.py) for how this is done. No information is needed from the lambda event JSON. Almost identical functionality to `trigger_mastertest_build`.

### update_bs_config
Lambda function name: `update-bs-config`. [Link](./torb/update_bs_config/).

Workflows: used in `ff_deploy_staging`

Update the configuration template of an existing ElasticBeanstalk environment. Takes `dest_env`, which is the environment name, and `template`, which is the name of the configuration template. Updates `waitfor_details` in the event JSON. Also updates `id` and `type` in event to coordinate with `waitfor` Lambda.

### update_foursight
Lambda function name: `update-foursight`. [Link](./torb/update_foursight/).

Workflows: used in `ff_deploy_staging`

Create a Foursight environment for an ElasticBeanstalk environment and PUT a check result to it. The settings for the Fourfront environment are determined automatically from the EB environment. Takes `dest_env`, which is the environment name.

### waitfor
Lambda function name: `waitfor`. [Link](./torb/waitfor/).

Workflows: used in `ff_deploy_staging`

Used as glue within a workflow by retrying until a specified condition is met using a "checker" function. Leverages the `type` and `item_id` within the event JSON and uses them to determine which checker function is used from a hardcoded list. Updates `waitfor_details` in the event JSON on each run.

## Torb Worklows
Torb also defines workflows that use AWS Step Functions composed of Lambda functions. See [this directory](./workflows/) for more information, as well as workflow definitions and example inputs. In the near future, `deploy_workflow` and `run_workflow` tasks will be created to facilitate easier testing and deployment.
