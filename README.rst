**Original Purpose**

Torbj√∂rn is the builder bot that builds our application and handles the automated deployment. It uses AWS Step Functions to orchestrate a number of individual lambda functions that control the various steps required for deployment and management of our servers.


Torb Lambda Functions
=====================

For the most part, Torb is defined by a number of lambda functions that are bundled and deployed using our fork of `python-lambda <https://github.com/4dn-dcic/python-lambda>`_.


create_beanstalk
----------------

.. warning::

    Obsolete. See more complete warning at top of file.

Lambda function name: `create-beanstalk`. `Link <./torb/create_beanstalk/>`_.

Workflows: used in `ff_deploy_staging`

Provide a variety of inputs (see service.py) to create a new ElasticBeanstalk (EB) environment or update an existing one. As part of this process, set EB environment variables and a configuration template. Also attempts to PUT a Foursight environment corresponding to the created EB environment.


create_es
---------

.. warning::

    Obsolete. See more complete warning at top of file.

Lambda function name: `create-es`. `Link <./torb/create_es/>`_.

Workflows: used in `ff_deploy_staging`

Provide input with `dest_env` to create a new Elasticsearch (ES) instance with the given identifier. Can optionally use `force_new_es` to always create a new ES instance, but this should probably not be used, as creating an ES instance by hand is usually the way to go. Updates `id` and `type` in event JSON to coordinate with `waitfor` Lambda.


create_rds
----------

.. warning::

    Obsolete. See more complete warning at top of file.

Lambda function name: `create-rds`. `Link <./torb/create_rds/>`_.

Workflows: None

Provide input with `dest_env` and `snapshot_arn` to create an RDS instance with the given ID from the given snapshot ARN. If a current instance already exists with that ID, this will delete it. If "fourfront-webprod" is in the ID, will skip this process due to the danger of deleting the production database.


snapshot_rds
------------

.. warning::

    Obsolete. See more complete warning at top of file.

Lambda function name: `snapshot-rds`. `Link <./torb/snapshot_rds/>`_.

Workflows: None

Provide input with `dest_env` and `snapshot_id` to take a snapshot of an RDS instance with the given ID. The snapshot will have the given name and will delete any existing snapshot with that name.


travis_deploy
-------------

.. warning::

    Obsolete. See more complete warning at top of file.

Lambda function name: `travis-deploy`. `Link <./torb/travis_deploy/>`_.

Workflows: used in `ff_deploy_staging`

Start a travis build and leverage the `tibanna_deploy` environment variables for the travis build to deploy to the "fourfront-mastertest" ElasticBeanstalk on a successful build. Can also leverage `merge_to` to merge a given branch into another one at the end of the build. Branches are determined by `event` and `merge_into` in the event JSON; ElasticBeanstalk environment is set with `dest_env`. See the `Fourfront travis config <https://github.com/4dn-dcic/fourfront/blob/d477c04181ff097bfd7fa59092c18e0c13540a90/.travis.yml#L106-L118>`_ and `deploy_beanstalk.py <https://github.com/4dn-dcic/fourfront/blob/master/deploy/deploy_beanstalk.py>`_ for how this is done. This is a bit different from `trigger_mastertest_build` and `trigger_webdev_build`, since it propogates the event output and therefore can be used within a step function. Writes request information to the `travis` subobject in the event. Also updates `id` and `type` in event to coordinate with `waitfor` Lambda.


trigger_mastertest_build
------------------------
Lambda function name: `trigger-mastertest-build`. `Link <./torb/trigger_mastertest_build/>`_.

.. warning::

    Obsolete. See more complete warning at top of file.

Workflows: None

Start a travis build and leverage the `tibanna_deploy` environment variable for the travis build to deploy to the "fourfront-mastertest" ElasticBeanstalk on a successful build. See the `Fourfront travis config <https://github.com/4dn-dcic/fourfront/blob/d477c04181ff097bfd7fa59092c18e0c13540a90/.travis.yml#L106-L118>`_ and `deploy_beanstalk.py <https://github.com/4dn-dcic/fourfront/blob/master/deploy/deploy_beanstalk.py>`_ for how this is done. No information is needed from the lambda event JSON. Almost identical functionality to `trigger_webdev_build`.


trigger_staging_build
---------------------

.. warning::

    Obsolete. See more complete warning at top of file.

Lambda function name: `trigger-staging-build`. `Link <./torb/trigger_staging_build/>`_.

Workflows: triggers `ff_deploy_staging`

Use `dcicutils.beanstalk_utils.compute_ff_prd_env` to determine which environments are data and staging, and kick off the `ff_deploy_staging` step function to make a fresh deploy to staging using Fourfront master. No information is needed from the lambda event JSON.


trigger_webdev_build
--------------------

.. warning::

    Obsolete. See more complete warning at top of file.

Lambda function name: `trigger-webdev-build`. `Link <./torb/trigger_webdev_build/>`_.

Workflows: None

Start a travis build and leverage the `tibanna_deploy` environment variable for the travis build to deploy to the "fourfront-webdev" ElasticBeanstalk on a successful build. See the `Fourfront travis config <https://github.com/4dn-dcic/fourfront/blob/d477c04181ff097bfd7fa59092c18e0c13540a90/.travis.yml#L106-L118>`_ and `deploy_beanstalk.py <https://github.com/4dn-dcic/fourfront/blob/master/deploy/deploy_beanstalk.py>`_ for how this is done. No information is needed from the lambda event JSON. Almost identical functionality to `trigger_mastertest_build`.


update_bs_config
----------------

.. warning::

    Obsolete. See more complete warning at top of file.

Lambda function name: `update-bs-config`. `Link <./torb/update_bs_config/>`_.

Workflows: used in `ff_deploy_staging`

Update the configuration template of an existing ElasticBeanstalk environment. Takes `dest_env`, which is the environment name, and `template`, which is the name of the configuration template. Updates `waitfor_details` in the event JSON. Also updates `id` and `type` in event to coordinate with `waitfor` Lambda.


update_foursight
----------------

.. warning::

    Obsolete. See more complete warning at top of file.

Lambda function name: `update-foursight`. `Link <./torb/update_foursight/>`_.

Workflows: used in `ff_deploy_staging`

Create a Foursight environment for an ElasticBeanstalk environment and PUT a check result to it. The settings for the Fourfront environment are determined automatically from the EB environment. Takes `dest_env`, which is the environment name.


waitfor
-------

.. warning::

    Obsolete. See more complete warning at top of file.

Lambda function name: `waitfor`. `Link <./torb/waitfor/>`_.

Workflows: used in `ff_deploy_staging`

Used as glue within a workflow by retrying until a specified condition is met using a "checker" function. Leverages the `type` and `item_id` within the event JSON and uses them to determine which checker function is used from a hardcoded list. Updates `waitfor_details` in the event JSON on each run.


Torb Worklows
=============


.. warning::

    Obsolete. See more complete warning at top of file.

Torb also defines workflows that use AWS Step Functions composed of Lambda functions. See `this directory <./workflows/>`_ for more information, as well as workflow definitions and example inputs. In the near future, `deploy_workflow` and `run_workflow` tasks will be created to facilitate easier testing and deployment.
